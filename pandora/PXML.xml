              A GameBoy Color Emulator still in development, thus marked 'beta'.
              While a few games have (minor) sound/gfx issues, most of them run great.
              
              Features an auto-continue option, that lets you continue where you left a game without having to save manually. 
              Also the battery-clock is emulated even when the emulator is not running, so that games such as Pokemon can be played as they are supposed to be.
