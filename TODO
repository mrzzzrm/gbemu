[Emulator]
    - Seperate SDL dependant and std-lib sys code
    - Check if all timing information is set correcly when games/states are loaded
    - Remove unnecessary calls to memset and SDL_FillRect 
    - Disable unneccesary printfs in release-mode
    - Remove sound.sample somehow
    - General sound sounds strange at times
    - Sometimes frames are skipped and the emu still sleeps heavily
