[Emulator]
    - Reaplce sys/sdl/video.c::buf with dynamic sized array
    - Optimize scan-system - not every pixel should have separate layer-tests  
    - Optimize scan-system - cache scans, only need to be updated un vram change   
    - Why is tima working for cgb? It should be too fast the way it is
    - Magic-Number replacement, especially for bitchecks
    - Take care of byte-order and datatype size, especially for savestates
    - Error menu to dialog
    - .sav: Asure sanity of hw-events queue
    - Dialogs during emulation should be shown using a moo_paused_do(func) mechanism

[Misc]
	- Build system, autotools
	
[Refactoring]
	- cards and states should use templated code
	- move config state into own struct
	- decide between mainloop based state and pause->do_something_else->continue
	- Lazy initialize menu components? Reduces spaghetti...
